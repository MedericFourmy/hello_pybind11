Learning about pybind11 and documenting it

Build
-----
- `pip install -e .` -- development mode  
- `pip install .` -- installation in site-packages

Run
---
`python3 test.py`


TODO
----
- Figure out why `pip install .` puts the .so module file directly in `site-pacakages`
- pytest
- entrypoints

Sources
----
Loosely based on [python_example](https://github.com/pybind/python_example) for code organization and [pybind11 doc](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) for examples.
